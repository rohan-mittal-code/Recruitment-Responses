This is a really big event with many important people attending it, so you have booked the auditorium for the particular day and have everything sorted out. But on the morning of the event you come to know that there was some confusion and the auditorium has been assigned to two different events on the same day. It is 8:00 in the morning and your event starts at 9:30 am. How will you handle this situation? Also what necessary steps will you take beforehand to make sure something like this never happens? ",
            "answer": "First of all, I will discuss with the other event's coordinator whether they plan to postpone their event. I would convince their team that our event is a really big one with many important guests in it. If no positive result takes place9which should be highly unlikely), I would try to look for other venues where our event can take place smoothly.\nTo prevent something like this in the future, I(along with my team) would be fully prepared with our event planning in a day or two in advance and notify the same to Clubs & Chapters Committee.

From which company would you get the speaker? Why?  ",
            "answer": "I would firstly require sample speakers from company B at least a week before the event to test the sound quality and technical glitches (if any) in them with our team.

Look how far the industry has come. Now a smartphone(as we call it now) lives up to its name for being smart, now it's not just a calling device, it is your substitute to your computer, calculator, television, radio, camera etc. Now the specs of the device matters, its speed, its RAM, its display all are now a determining factor when you go on to buy one for yourself.\nTHIS IS THE DRAMATIC REVOLUTION, AND THIS SURELY IS THE FUTURE.\n"

And whether or not can they compromise on that time , like rescheduling it to a later time on the same day. As my event is almost within 2 hours and it would be too late to reschedule it. \nEven trimming down the length of the event could be used as a last resort.\nwe would put up a display board outside the event room/hall. About the rescheduled timing of the events with an apology for the inconvenience caused.\n\nI believe the cause for this confusion would have been caused by the person/committee responsible for assigning the hall to the clubs/chapters. For it to be never repeated again i would advise them to make a proper record of which team has been assigned which hall/room and should re-check with them atleast 2 days before the e  "
